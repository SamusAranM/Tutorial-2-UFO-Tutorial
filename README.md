# Tutorial 2-UFO Tutorial

I ended up finishing the tutorial without noticing the "... go to the Unity Asset Store to download the project. You don't need to do this, and in fact, I would rather you didn't." 

So the files that have "(Completed)" or "Complete" in the game are not mine, it's just what came with the Assets I downloaded.

The prefabs and scripts that I made are located in Tutorial-2-UFO-Tutorial -> Beginner 2D UFO Game -> Assets -> _Completed-Assets 

The scene that I created is located in Tutorial-2-UFO-Tutorial -> Beginner 2D UFO Game -> Assets -> Scenes -> Main
